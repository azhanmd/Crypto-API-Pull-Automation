# Crypto-API-Pull-Automation
In this project, I performed an API Pull on a Crypto Website using the Pandas Library to automatically track the top 15 cryptocurrencies over time. Then I examined the data obtained over a short period of time to uncover insights. This project was done using a Jupyter Notebook.
